SellersToolbox is an application for Amazon Store owners to manage their inventory and track statistics about sales, shipments, returns and more.

My job with SellersToolbox was to work with Rainy Day Media LLC to create an updated dashboard for the site's users with modern styling and technology. The existing site was static in width, and without much styling. We developed a format that would allowed for easier navigation and a cleaner user interface throughout the massive amounts of available data.

Since the site's functionality was to be carried to the new site, we developed the product with a Foundation framework for a faster transition, and restyled to taste. The responsive grid system allows the site's content to adapt to the screen of it's user instead of creating a separate applicatoin for mobile devices. While not all features are available on mobile, the added benefit of the site's responsiveness is that it opens up customers the option of managing inventory from their warehouse or track shipments from anywhere which was previously impossible with the old site.
