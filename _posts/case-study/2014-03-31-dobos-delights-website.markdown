Dobo's Delights is a bakery in Piqua, Ohio who specializes in Hungarian Pastries. The business was getting a growing number of clients from other areas due to their specialty. Creative Fuse Initiative was hired to recreate the site with a fresh design, and a more secure CMS. 

It was my job to design the site with a simplified navigation and showcase more of the product. I used a bright color pallete and floral accents similar to Hungarian artwork to accentuate her specialty, large graphics to showcase the food, and a hand-drawn baked-goods pattern for the background, giving the site a more relaxed feel to match the store's personality.

The process of developing the site involved creating the site in HTML and CSS, porting the templates to Wordpress and integrating Woocommerce in order to make updating and tracking orders more simple.
