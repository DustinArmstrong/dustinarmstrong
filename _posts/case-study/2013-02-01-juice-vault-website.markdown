JuiceVault is an application that was created as an experiment in rapid product development with [Jacob Weaver](https://github.com/jweaver60). Over the period of 3 days, the application was conceived, developed, and built with Ruby on Rails using Foundation for a base-layer. With a rapid growth in electronic-cigarette users, we felt this was a market that was missing some much desired tools.

The product is intended for people who use electronic cigarettes to keep track of the different flavored juices that they have tried. JuiceVault allows the user to find new flavors, flavors that they enjoy, or add flavors from their favorite vendors to the site if they aren't already present. After a juice has been added, they have the option of publicly rating, favoriting, or commenting on the juice. All favorited juices show on the user's dashboard, along with their personal rating, allowing a quick reference for flavors they have enjoyed.

The site was launched using Heroku, and within the first week had over 200 active users by using minimal social media marketing.
