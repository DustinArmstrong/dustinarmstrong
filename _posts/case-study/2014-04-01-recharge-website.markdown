RE:CHARGE was an event hosted by Rainy Day Media LLC. and Grab2. The goal of the event was to get creative entrepeneurs in one place where they would be able to talk about what they're doing in a relaxed environment with no pressure of lectures, obligations to network, or having to pitch their company. 

The event was created over the period of one week from concept to execution. My duties in the project consisted of creating a brand name and logo concept, designing a website for people to learn about the event, create promotional goods, and design/coordinate/produce an application that would allow users to check in to the event with their social network of choice. The products were created with versatility in mind. The application was displayed on a touch screen display at the entrance, and available for access on your mobile phone.

The result of our efforts produced over 200 visitors, and word of the event has spread nationally among tech-startup organizations and event-coordinators.
