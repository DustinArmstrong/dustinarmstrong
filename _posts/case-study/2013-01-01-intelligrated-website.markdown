Intelligrated is a company that creates automated material handling solutions for companies around the world. The company was growing rapidly, and needed a new website to reflect the hundreds of products and services they offered. With the scale of their reach, it was important that the site not only display the information and vendor resources easily, but also be multilingual and easily expandable.

My job was to coordinate the design, development, and content of the site. The design was created based on their existing branding guidelines and the style of their existing promotional goods. The goal was to create a technological feel, while still accomodating the large amount of content they had to offer. 

After the design had met the standards of the branding guidelines, we moved forward with a Drupal CMS for the back end of the site. I worked with a freelancer to design and create the needed templates for the site. Over the period of 4 months, the site was completed with over 2,000 pages which included carefully crafted images and hand-placed content in English, French and Spanish. The site stayed active for 4 years before being recently updated.
