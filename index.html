						<p>Dobo's Delights is a bakery in Piqua, Ohio who specializes in Hungarian Pastries. The business was getting a growing number of clients from other areas due to their specialty. Creative Fuse Initiative was hired to recreate the site with a fresh design, and a more secure CMS.</p>

						<p>It was my job to design the site with a simplified navigation and showcase more of the product. I used a bright color pallete and floral accents similar to Hungarian artwork to accentuate her specialty, large graphics to showcase the food, and a hand-drawn baked-goods pattern for the background, giving the site a more relaxed feel to match the store's personality.</p>

						<p>The process of developing the site involved creating the site in HTML and CSS, porting the templates to Wordpress and integrating Woocommerce in order to make updating and tracking orders more simple.</p>

						<p>RE:CHARGE was an event hosted by Rainy Day Media LLC. and Grab2. The goal of the event was to get creative entrepeneurs in one place where they would be able to talk about what they're doing in a relaxed environment with no pressure of lectures, obligations to network, or having to pitch their company.</p>

						<p>The event was created over the period of one week from concept to execution. My duties in the project consisted of creating a brand name and logo concept, designing a website for people to learn about the event, create promotional goods, and design/coordinate/produce an application that would allow users to check in to the event with their social network of choice. The products were created with versatility in mind. The application was displayed on a touch screen display at the entrance, and available for access on your mobile phone.</p>

						<p>The result of our efforts produced over 200 visitors, and word of the event has spread nationally among tech-startup organizations and event-coordinators.</p>

						<p>Intelligrated is a company that creates automated material handling solutions for companies around the world. The company was growing rapidly, and needed a new website to reflect the hundreds of products and services they offered. With the scale of their reach, it was important that the site not only display the information and vendor resources easily, but also be multilingual and easily expandable.</p>

						<p>My job was to coordinate the design, development, and content of the site. The design was created based on their existing branding guidelines and the style of their existing promotional goods. The goal was to create a technological feel, while still accomodating the large amount of content they had to offer.</p>

						<p>After the design had met the standards of the branding guidelines, we moved forward with a Drupal CMS for the back end of the site. I worked with a freelancer to design and create the needed templates for the site. Over the period of 4 months, the site was completed with over 2,000 pages which included carefully crafted images and hand-placed content in English, French and Spanish. The site stayed active for 4 years before being recently updated.</p>

						<p>SellersToolbox is an application for Amazon Store owners to manage their inventory and track statistics about sales, shipments, returns and more.</p>

						<p>My job with SellersToolbox was to work with Rainy Day Media LLC to create an updated dashboard for the site's users with modern styling and technology. The existing site was static in width, and without much styling. We developed a format that would allowed for easier navigation and a cleaner user interface throughout the massive amounts of available data.</p>

						<p>Since the site's functionality was to be carried to the new site, we developed the product with a Foundation framework for a faster transition, and restyled to taste. The responsive grid system allows the site's content to adapt to the screen of it's user instead of creating a separate applicatoin for mobile devices. While not all features are available on mobile, the added benefit of the site's responsiveness is that it opens up customers the option of managing inventory from their warehouse or track shipments from anywhere which was previously impossible with the old site.</p>

						<p>The Troy Strawberry Festival has been happening anually since 1977 in Troy, Ohio. With parades, arts &amp; crafts, and more strawberry based foods than you could ever imagine.</p>

						<p>The organization contacted the Creative Fuse Initiative to develop a customized theme for the event to replace the purchased Wordpress template they had been using. Our team managed to design a site that is remiscent of the hand-crafted feel the event brings, and is easy to update for future events. The site also serves as a resource for users to submit vendor forms, arrange events, and keep track of the statuses of each project.</p>
